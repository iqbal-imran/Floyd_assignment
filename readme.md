**About the project**

TThe Floyd Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a directed graph, where each edge connecting a pair of vertices has either a positive or negative edge weight. The algorithm calculates the shortest path between every pair of vertices by considering all possible intermediate vertices, and follows a dynamic programming approach. The purpose of this exercise is to rewrite the algorithm to use recursion.

**Requirements**

The script requires the latest version of Python (current version - Python 3.11.3)
