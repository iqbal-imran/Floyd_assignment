**About the project**

I start coding with the concept of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices from a two dimensional list. I came up with a solution by implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm via a Recursive approch to solve the problem.

We expect the latest version of Python must be installed on your computer before you try to run the script. The script can be executed either from a terminal or any good editor.

We can also import the Floyd module in their own script and look for the method _get_floyd_recursive_solution. We can either store the value in a variable or print the return to see as a result the shortest path is found.

As a conclusion, we found that recursive methods are easy to understand and implement in certain cases than iterative ones.

**Requirements**

The script requires the latest version of Python. By the time I created the script, the latest version was Python 3.11.3

**Usage**

### Windows Computer
Extract the directory with any given name you would like to give to any place on your computer.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the newly created folder you have just extracted.
Now type floyd.py and press enter
The script will show you the shortest path between vertices.

### Mac Computer
Once the directory is Extracted save it in a proper place on your computer.
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you have stored all the files.
This time run python --version to see if the python is already installed in your computer. If the answer is in affirmative form all is set you can now proceed with the next step or you have to download the Python before taking any further steps.
Navigate to the file and type floyd.py. It will bring the shortest path available between vertices by running a function.
